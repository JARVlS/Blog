## What we are looking for and why

When looking for a new Laptop as a programmer, much thought has to be put into what is needed, what you want and what would be nice to have. I consciously distinguish between those three categories as I do think every aspect should be properly considered. However, gaming is an entirely different topic with different needs.

In the following, we are going to look into what you will need for either topic.

### What is needed

Most tasks in programming do not need the most advanced hardware or the latest processor. All you really need is a comfortable keyboard and a screen that is of a sufficient size to see the code you are working on.

However, for gaming, you not only need a high power machine, you also might have some additional needs like fast charging or a mechanical keyboard. You especially will want a GPU (Graphics Card) that is capable on delivering on your expectations for gaming. So if you want to be able to game at 120Hz on QHD or even 4K, you're gonna want the good stuff ;)


### Top 5 Things to look for

In the following, I will provide an outline for what to look for in a new Laptop. Note, that this is only a recommendation and does not apply to

#summary
**CPU**

#content
- **Core Count**: More is better
    - The more cores, the better the CPU can handle multi-tasking and multi-threaded applications
- **Clock Speed**: Higher is better
    - The clock speed determines, how quickly the CPU can execute instructions. 
    - You should look for base clock speeds at or above 2.5GHz and turbo bust speeds at of at least 4GHz
- **Cache Size**: Bigger is better
    - A CPU's cache size determines how quickly it can access frequently used data
    - Look for at least 8MB
- **Generation**: Higher is better
    - You should look for newer generation CPUs as they generally offer better performance and efficiency
- **AMD or Intel**: 
    - Pro AMD
        - Better multi-core performance
        - Generally more affordable than comparable Intel CPUs
    - Pro Intel
        - Better single-core performance
        - Generally are more power-efficient

#summary
**GPU**

#content
- **Dedicated GPU**: Essential for gaming
    - Integrated graphics, while suitable for most productivity tasks, may struggle with demanding games.
- **VRAM**: More is better
    - The amount of VRAM (Video Random Access Memory) on the GPU is important 
    - You should look for GPUs with at least 4GB of VRAM, but ideally, 6GB-8GB or more for better performance
- **Clock Speed**: Higher is better
    - Similar to CPUs, the clock speed of a GPU determines how quickly it can execute instructions
    - Look for at least 1.5GHz base clock speed and 1.8GHz boost clock speed
- **CUDA Cores (NVIDIA GPUs) or Stream Processors (AMD GPUs)**: More is better
    - The number of CUDA cores or stream processors on a GPU determines how many parallel computing tasks it can handl
- **Thermal Design Power (TDP)**: Lower is better
    - The TDP of a GPU determines how much power it requires and how much heat it generates
    - look for GPUs with lower TDPs, as they will be more power-efficient and generate less heat, leading to longer battery life and better overall performance

- **Brand and driver support**
    - The brand of the GPU can affect compatibility with certain games and applications
    -  It's important to research the specific games and applications you plan to use and ensure that the GPU you choose is compatible

#summary
**RAM**

#content

### **Amount**
As a guideline, you should have **at least 16GB of RAM** in your machine. 

- When more?
    - If you plan on working with 3D modeling software for your projects
        - In this case, 32GB of RAM is recommended
    - If one of your games needs more (individual needs)

### **Speed**
Speed is not as important as many people think for gaming, with the exception of some very specific games.
- You should get RAM at a minimum of about 3200Mhz or higher which is provided in most laptops
    - However, you are not going to see much difference from here on upwards

### **Upgradability**
Much more important can be the option to upgrade your amount or speed of RAM later on.
- Make sure, that if you are not at 32GB of RAM, that it is upgradable

#summary
**Screen**

#content

- **Summarized**
    - Overall, a 14-inch display with a resolution of 1920x1080 (FHD) and a refresh rate of 120Hz is a good choice 
    - Even better is a 16:10 aspect ratio, as it provides more vertical space. That can help with getting a better overview or more code on your screen.
    - For more info check out the following points 
- **Size**: 
    - Pro big:
        - A bigger screen means better gaming experience
        - You can see more code or applications
    - Contra big:
        - A big screen means a big Laptop and therefore less mobility 
    - **Recommendation**: 
        - Best: 14"
            - Maximum mobility combined with almost best gaming experience
        - Minimum: 13"
            - Mostly suited for mobility
        - Maximum: 15.6"
            - For best gaming experience 
            - Limits mobility but not too much 

- **Resolution**: 
    - Higher resolutions provide better image quality and detail, which can enhance the gaming and coding experience
    - Good gaming/coding experience: Full HD - 1920x1080 pixels
    - Better experience: Quad HD - 2560x1440 pixels **(recommended for most)**
    - Best experience (mostly for big screens): 4K Ultra HD - 3840x2160 pixels
    - *Note*, that a higher resolution also needs better hardware as it requires more performance 
- **Refresh Rate**: Higher is better
    - For gaming: Higher refresh rate provides smoother, more fluid experience (if your hardware is up to it)
    - For coding: Generally nicer experience (for scrolling and reading)
    - **Recommendation**: 
        - 120Hz is the way to go for most people however if you really want a premium experience, you should go for 144Hz or even 240Hz
- **Panel type**
    - The type of panel (IPS, TN or VA) can affect the color accuracy, viewing angles and response time of the display. 
    - **Recommendation**: An IPS panel is recommended, as it provides good color accuracy and wide viewing angles 
- **Aspect Ratio**
    - For developers, it is mostly recommended to look for a device with a 16:10 aspect ratio
        - It provides more vertical space on your screen
        - Therefore, you see more code or lines in your terminal, which can provide a much more pleasant experience
    - However, 16:9 aspect-ratios are still the standard and work almost as well for most people

**Keyboard**

#content
### **Coding**
As a developer, pentester or simply a person who spends a lot of time at their device, your keyboard is your weapon of choice. It should feel comfortable to type on, provide you with stability as well as speed. 
- That speeks in favor of a rubberdome keyboard as most people find them to be more comfortable to type on. 

### **Gaming**
For gamers, there are even more factors to consider. 
- **Key switches** - At first, you have to decide, whether you even want a mechenical keyboard. If you do, here is what to look for
    - Your key switches will not only determine how it feels to type on the keyboard. They also affect
        - Sound: E.g. Brown Switches are loud / Red are silent 
        - Key travel: How much can the key travel and how much travel will activate it
    - Most common and recommended are Cherry MX or Razer switches

- **Key rollover**
    - Refers to how many keys can be pressed simultaneously without losing inputs.
    - At least 6-key-rollover 
    - Recommended: n-key-rollover (unlimited number of keys pressed)

- **Anti-Ghosting**
    - Prevents keys from being registered incorrectly when multiple keys are pressed.
    - This is very important for gaming, as "fast and accurate" is every gamers dream 


### **Both**
There are some things, that are suited both for gaming and coding
- **Backlight**
    - For those late-night coding sessions you want to have a backlight keyboard to see what you are typing
    - If you are dimming down your room for a gaming session to have more immersive experience, you wouldn't want to loose track of your keyboard...
- **Build quality**
    - Frequent use of your new Laptop is literally pre-programmed and therefore, the one device that will be used the most - your keyboard -  has to be durable
    - You might even want to go for a waterproof model as in some instances, you will want to have a beverage by your side without fearing for your laptop ;)
